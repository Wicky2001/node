1.Get file path dyamically

import { dirname } from "path";
import { fileURLToPath } from "url";

const __dirname = dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url));

the __dirname give the path to the our project folder from the root.

ex-: suppose our index.js file is reside in "myFirstProject".
Then the __dir => "C:\Users\Wicky\Documents\GitHub\node\myFirstProject"



2.middlewares(Custom middleware)

-middlewares triggers before endpoints
-app.use() method is use to set middlewares

ex - app.use(end_point_name,function_to_trigger)
     
    app.use("/dashBoard", (req, res, next) => {
    console.log("Hello I'm dashboard middleware");
    next();
});

-next() method allows to pass the execution to other endpoints and middlewares.
-next() pass the execution to the next middle ware in stack.
- if we do not specify next() code lines after next not going to execute.

ex-: 

app.use("/dashBoard", (req, res, next) => {
  console.log("Hello I'm dashboard middleware"); --> 0
  next();
});

app.use("/dashBoard", (req, res, next) => {   --> 1
  console.log("Hello I'm next middleware");
  
});


app.get("/dashBoard", (req, res) => {          --> 2
  console.log("I'm dashboard get endpoint");
});

- when a get request come to "/dashboard" end point first it go through 0 miidle ware.
- then 0 pass that it to next middle ware which is 1 using next.
- here the code inside 2 do not get execute because we didn't specify next() in 1's body


- here the order of middleware is matter.if we put middle ware after endpoint it do not work

- if we do not specify end_point_name in app.use() the middleware will trigger for all the incomming
  requests 

app.use((req, res, next) => {   --> 1
  console.log("Hello I'm next middleware");
  
});


3.body parser

-body parser is a middleware which is use to parse the URL encoded data inside incomming requests such as
 form data in a post request

-It read all data and add attribute name - "body" to request. so we can access data inside
 request using "req.body"

-In new version of express this functionality is embeded in to express so we do not need to separately
 install it.

 

3.morgan 

morgan is a 3rd party middleware which is use to log the request comming in to the created server.
